Finding Fixations using the Velocity Threshold Algorithm

We also compare the results obtained form running the custom I-VT algorithm with those obtained from running a commercial software application - SMI BeGaze - on a given eye movemment data.

Five participants and four stimuli (images) were considered for this experiment.

Results show that the number of fixations reported for each trial by the I-VT algorithm is similar to that reported by SMI BeGaze. There was a slight variation in the number with an average difference of 6 fixations per trial.

The I-VT algorithm was run with varying velocity thresholds - 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00, 1.10, 1.15, 1.20, 1.30, 1.40, 1.50 px/s. The number of fixations obtained for each has been plotted as a graph and compared to the SMI BeGaze results.

All the results are available in the "Results" directory.

The RStudio workspace is available in the "Workspace" directory.

The four stimuli considered for this experiment are available in the "Stimuli" directory.
